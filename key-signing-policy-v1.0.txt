This policy is valid from 2013-11-03 for signatures made by my GnuPG key
with Key ID 0x6E343EEA. (Some signatures before this date were also made
under the following conditions. No key was ever signed without checking
the identity of the person and the fingerprint.)

This policy may be replaced by a new version. All versions with corresponding
links are listed in the changelog.

Before I sign a key, I
  - verify the identity of the person owning the to-be-signed key by 
    either knowing them for a long time or looking at their identity 
    card or equivalent proof of identity.
  - receive the key fingerprint from the key owner directly and in hardcopy.


A signature is always on an user id. By signing an user id, I confirm that the 
person, who gave me the fingerprint of that key, has the claimed name. I do
not sign user ids with pseudonyms or corporate ids.


Description of my use of trustlevels:
- ---
sig3 - I have verified the identity and verified, that the e-mail address
       of the signed uid belongs to the person, who has control over the
       key. This is done by a challenge-response system or by sending the
       signed key to the corresponding user id (both via encrypted mail).

sig2 - I have verified the identity - but not the e-mail address (for
       example because the key does not support encryption to it).

sig1 - unused

You can get my key from one of the public keyservers (like hkp://pgp.mit.edu).
